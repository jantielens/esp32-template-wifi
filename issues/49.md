## Updated Approach

### Browser-Mediated Update from Static GitHub Pages

- The workflow will now leverage browser-mediated updates originating from GitHub Pages. 

### Dynamic Base URL Generation

- The base URL for GitHub Pages will be dynamically derived from the baked-in repository slug returned by the API call: `GET /api/info`. This will format as `repo:"owner/repo"`.

### OTA Manifest Generation

- The system will generate OTA manifests located at `ota/<board>.json`. Each manifest entry will include:
  - `version`
  - `url`
  - `sha256`
  - `size`

### Removal of GitHub Releases OTA Flow

- All aspects related to GitHub Releases for OTA updates will be eliminated, including:
  - The API call: `/api/firmware/latest`
  - The flag: `GITHUB_UPDATES_ENABLED`
  - All related legacy code.

### POST API Updates

- The `POST /api/firmware/update` endpoint will be repurposed to accept the firmware URL directly.
- The endpoint `/api/update` will still support manual uploads.

### CORS Configuration

- The following CORS requirements will be implemented:
  - **OPTIONS Method**  
  - Allow-Origin  
  - Allow-Headers: `Authorization`, `Content-Type`

### Basic Auth Behavior

- Implement an authentication gateway for Basic Auth to secure the endpoints, ensuring only authorized users can access specific routes.

### Conclusion
These changes are intended to streamline the firmware update process, enhance security, and simplify the overall workflow with GitHub Pages.
