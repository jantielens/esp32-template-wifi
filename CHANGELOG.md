## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.58] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- OTA rollback protection: `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()` called at end of `setup()` — prevents bootloader from reverting firmware after a clean startup
- Heap integrity check in 60-second heartbeat: `heap_caps_check_integrity_all()` catches heap corruption early
- `monitor.sh --log` / `--log=<file>` flag: serial output is simultaneously saved to a timestamped log file via `tee`
- `i2c_bus.cpp/h`: lightweight FreeRTOS mutex wrapper for shared I2C bus access across tasks (`i2c_bus_init`, `i2c_bus_lock`, `i2c_bus_unlock`)
- MQTT subscription infrastructure in `MqttManager`: `addSubscription(topic, handler)` registers per-topic callbacks; handlers are re-subscribed automatically after each reconnect
- `mqtt_wake.cpp/h`: subscribes to a configurable MQTT topic and wakes the screen saver when an `ON`/`1`/`true` payload is received
- `DeviceConfig.screen_saver_wake_topic` field (64-byte, `#if HAS_MQTT && HAS_DISPLAY`): persisted in NVS, exposed in web portal Home page and REST API
- Host-native unit test infrastructure in `tests/`: `run_tests.sh`, stub headers (`Arduino.h`, `log_manager.h`, `board_config.h`), and `stubs.cpp`; 40 test cases covering `power_config` parse functions and `config_manager_sanitize_device_name`
- Unit test CI step in `.github/workflows/build.yml`: `unit-tests` job runs before firmware builds; firmware build now depends on tests passing
- `DisplayManager::goBack()` and `display_manager_go_back()` C-API: navigate to the previous screen in an 8-deep history stack
- WiFi resilience: gateway liveness watchdog using `esp_ping` — forces reconnect after 3 consecutive ping failures even when `WiFi.status()` still reports connected

### Changed
- `DisplayManager` navigation history replaced single `previousScreen` pointer with an 8-entry `screenHistory` stack; splash screen is excluded from history
- ESP32-P4 WiFi startup: replaced fixed `delay(5000)` with a MAC-address polling loop (250 ms poll, 8 s cap) to reduce boot time when ESP-Hosted link is fast
- ESP32-P4 WiFi retry delay reduced from 2000 ms to 500 ms between reconnect attempts
- `wifi_manager_watchdog` refactored: status-lost path and ping-fail path share a single reconnect+mDNS code block; `g_last_wifi_check_ms` updated at entry to prevent overlapping checks

## [0.0.57] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- MIPI-DSI base class (`MipiDsiDriver`) — shared implementation for all ESP32-P4 DSI panels: DSI bus init, DBI command channel, DPI panel with DMA2D async flush, backlight PWM, vendor command sending, and LVGL integration
- GUITION JC4880P433 (ST7701S) now uses direct ESP-IDF DSI driver (was Arduino_GFX wrapper): ~2× FPS improvement (25 → 44 fps)
- Per-panel `disable_lp` flag in `MipiDsiTimingConfig`: ST7703 needs `true` (continuous HS mode), ST7701S needs `false` (LP during blanking)
- `DISPLAY_PANEL` define added to DSI board overrides for generated driver table

### Changed
- ST7703 DSI driver refactored from standalone ~400-line implementation to thin ~80-line subclass of `MipiDsiDriver`
- ST7701 DSI driver refactored from Arduino_GFX wrapper to thin ~80-line subclass of `MipiDsiDriver` (vendor init commands extracted from Arduino_GFX source)
- `display_drivers.cpp` now includes `mipi_dsi_driver.cpp` before each DSI subclass

### Fixed
- Horizontal jitter (~15px content shifting) on JC4880P433: caused by `disable_lp=true` being hardcoded — ST7701S expects LP signaling during blanking intervals
- Stale log message in DSI init: `disable_lp=true` was hardcoded in log string instead of reflecting actual per-panel value

## [0.0.56] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- LVGL v8.4.0 → v9.5.0 upgrade across all boards
- DMA2D async flush for ESP32-P4 DSI driver (hardware-accelerated framebuffer copy replaces CPU memcpy)
- TouchTestScreen ported to LVGL v9 Canvas API (layer-based drawing: `lv_canvas_init_layer` / `lv_draw_rect` / `lv_canvas_finish_layer`)
- Canvas memory fallback: tries PSRAM first, falls back to internal RAM for non-PSRAM boards (e.g., CYD v2)
- On-screen error message when canvas allocation fails on memory-constrained devices
- PPA (Pixel Processing Accelerator) support gated on `SOC_PPA_SUPPORTED` for cross-board compatibility
- `IRAM_ATTR` for LVGL fast memory gated to ESP32-P4 and ESP32-S3 only (prevents IRAM overflow on classic ESP32)
- `LV_USE_CANVAS` conditionally enabled only when `HAS_TOUCH` is set
- TouchTestScreen compilation guarded by `HAS_TOUCH && LV_USE_CANVAS` for clean compile-out

### Changed
- All LVGL API calls migrated to v9: `lv_display_*`, `lv_screen_load`, `lv_obj_delete`, `lv_indev_active`, `LV_COLOR_FORMAT_RGB565`, etc.
- Display manager uses v9 `lv_display_create()` / `lv_display_set_buffers()` / `lv_display_set_flush_cb()`
- Draw buffers use `heap_caps_aligned_alloc()` with 64-byte alignment for PPA/DMA compatibility
- Touch manager uses v9 `lv_indev_create()` / `lv_indev_set_read_cb()`
- Flush callback passes v9 stride info to drivers via `flushSrcStride`
- PNG asset generator updated for LVGL v9 image descriptor format (`lv_image_dsc_t`, `LV_IMAGE_HEADER_MAGIC`)
- `lv_conf.h` restructured: consolidated draw/rendering, PPA, and widget sections with cross-board conditional compilation
- ESP32-P4 DSI driver: `pushColors()` uses `esp_lcd_panel_draw_bitmap()` with DMA2D instead of manual memcpy + cache writeback

### Fixed
- PPA build error on non-P4 boards: `LV_USE_PPA` was unconditionally set to 1
- IRAM overflow on classic ESP32 (CYD v2): `LV_ATTRIBUTE_FAST_MEM IRAM_ATTR` exceeded `iram0_0_seg` by 16KB
- `CONFIG_LV_DRAW_BUF_ALIGN` bridge was defined before `LV_USE_PPA`, making it ineffective on ESP32-P4
- TouchTestScreen canvas allocation failure on non-PSRAM boards (PSRAM-only `heap_caps_malloc`)

### Removed
- ST7789V2 native SPI display driver (`st7789v2_driver.cpp/h`) and `esp32c3-waveshare-169-st7789v2` board target (hardware no longer in use)
- Unused `ssidLabel` member from InfoScreen

## [0.0.55] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- ESP32-P4 board support: Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4B (720×720 ST7703 MIPI-DSI + GT911 touch)
- ST7703 MIPI-DSI display driver using direct ESP-IDF calls (bypasses Arduino_GFX for DSI path)
- Custom 32MB flash partition table with 8MB OTA slots (`partitions_ota_8mb_32MB.csv`)
- Performance analysis doc (`docs/esp32-p4-display-performance.md`) with A/B test data

### Fixed
- ESP32-P4 cyan/idle-color display flashes caused by DSI LP transitions during blanking intervals
  - Root cause: Arduino_GFX `Arduino_ESP32DSIPanel` does not set `disable_lp=true` in DPI panel config
  - Fix: direct ESP-IDF DSI init with `.flags.disable_lp = true` keeps D-PHY in HS mode continuously
  - Result: ~40 fps (up from ~30), cyan flashes eliminated
- ESP32-P4 bootloader offset (0x2000) added to `upload.sh` for `--full` flash mode

### Changed
- LVGL draw buffers use internal RAM on ESP32-P4 (`LVGL_BUFFER_PREFER_INTERNAL true`) — +4 fps vs PSRAM
- LVGL refresh period lowered to 15 ms on ESP32-P4 (matches IDF reference projects)
- `pushColors()` flush path uses `memcpy()` per row + `esp_cache_msync()` (replaces per-pixel copy)

### Removed
- Image API subsystem: `strip_decoder`, `lvgl_jpeg_decoder`, `direct_image_screen`, `lvgl_image_screen`, `image_api`, `jpeg_preflight` (~3900 lines)
- `HAS_IMAGE_API` compile flag and all board overrides
- `tools/upload_image.py` and `tools/camera_to_esp32.py`

### Documentation
- Updated display-touch-architecture, compile-time-flags, web-portal, scripts, drivers README
- Regenerated `docs/compile-time-flags.md`

## [0.0.54] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- GT911 touch: `isTouched()` returned stale cached data — screen saver wake-on-touch broken on ESP32-4848S040 (#73)
- upload.sh `--full` mode: hardcoded `0xE000` otadata offset corrupts NVS on custom partition layouts; now dynamically resolved from partition table (#74)

## [0.0.53] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- FPS benchmark screen: spinning arc animation with live panel FPS, present/render/frame timing (navigate via web portal screen API)
- Async present task for Buffered render mode (jc3248w535): decouples slow QSPI panel transfer from LVGL timer loop, allowing touch input and animations to process at ~50 Hz instead of ~4 Hz
- Dirty-row spinlock in Arduino_GFX driver: thread-safe tracking between LVGL flush and async present task

### Fixed
- Task watchdog crash on jc3248w535: present task now pinned to opposite core from LVGL task (both at priority 1 on same core starved IDLE0's WDT reset)

## [0.0.52] - 2026-02-13

### Changed
- Upgraded ESP32 Arduino core from 3.3.5 to 3.3.7 (resolves #58)
- Upgraded Arduino_GFX (GFX Library for Arduino) from 1.6.4 to 1.6.5 (fixes `spiFrequencyToClockDiv` SPI API breakage with core ≥3.3.6)
- Removed "pinned for library compatibility" comment in setup.sh — no longer needed

### Fixed
- GT911 touch: single taps registering as double taps on esp32-4848S040 (GT911 `bufferStatus=0` between scans was incorrectly interpreted as finger-up, causing a false RELEASED→PRESSED cycle that fired two CLICKED events)
- GT911 touch: `isTouched()` had no return statement (undefined behavior)

## [0.0.51] - 2026-02-13

### Changed
- **jc3636w518**: replaced ESP_Panel library with Arduino_GFX for ST77916 display (fixes I2C driver conflict, #67)
  - New `Arduino_GFX_ST77916_Driver`: direct rendering via `draw16bitRGBBitmap()` (no PSRAM framebuffer needed, saves ~253 KB)
  - New `Wire_CST816S_TouchDriver`: pure Wire.h I2C driver with auto-sleep disable
  - Removed `ESP32_Display_Panel@1.0.4` and `ESP32_IO_Expander@1.1.1` library dependencies
  - Deleted `esp_panel_st77916_driver.cpp/h` and `esp_panel_cst816s_touch_driver.cpp/h`
- Renamed `TOUCH_DRIVER_AXS15231B` → `TOUCH_DRIVER_AXS15231B_I2C` for consistency

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/display-touch-architecture.md`: replaced ESP_Panel references with Arduino_GFX/Wire
- Updated `docs/compile-time-flags.md`: regenerated flag report
- Regenerated `src/app/drivers/README.md` board→drivers table

## [0.0.50] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- jc3248w535: PSRAM framebuffer with driver-level rotation replaces Arduino_Canvas (eliminates GFX API overhead)
- jc3248w535: dirty-row tracking — `present()` sends only rows `0..maxDirtyRow` instead of full 480 rows

### Fixed
- AXS15231B touch driver: complete rewrite of I2C protocol (11-byte command per Espressif reference, correct response byte layout, event field state machine with `touchActive` flag to prevent double-tap artifacts from stale controller replays)
- Phantom CLICKED events after screen switch: `lv_indev_reset(NULL, NULL)` called after every deferred screen transition in DisplayManager
- Touch test screen: use LVGL runtime dimensions (`lv_disp_get_hor/ver_res`) instead of compile-time `DISPLAY_WIDTH/HEIGHT` (fixes canvas mismatch on rotated displays)
- Touch test screen: ghost touch suppression via `touch_manager_suppress_lvgl_input(200)` on show
- jc3636w518 build: migrate ESP32_Display_Panel API to v1.0.4 (class renames, namespace changes)

### Changed
- Bump `ESP32_Display_Panel` library from 0.1.4 to 1.0.4
- LVGL touch polling rate reduced from 30 ms to 10 ms (`LV_INDEV_DEF_READ_PERIOD`) for more responsive touch input
- Touch test screen canvas allocated in PSRAM on show, freed on hide (zero memory cost while inactive)
- Removed all diagnostic I2C logging from AXS15231B vendored touch driver (692 bytes smaller)

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/display-touch-architecture.md`: added AXS15231B, CST816S, GT911 touch driver docs; updated touch event flow and screen switching; added TouchTestScreen description; refreshed file organization and future enhancements

## [0.0.49] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- ESP32-4848S040 board support (Guition ESP32-S3, ST7701 RGB 480×480, 16 MB flash, 8 MB OPI PSRAM)
- ST7701 RGB display driver via Arduino_GFX delegation (SWSPI → ESP32RGBPanel → RGB_Display)
- GT911 I2C touch driver (vendored, Wire1 bus) with cached `isTouched()` to avoid redundant I2C reads
- Touch test screen (red dots + white connecting lines on LVGL canvas)
- Board-overridable `ST7701_PCLK_HZ` (default 6 MHz) and `ST7701_BOUNCE_BUFFER_LINES` defines
- `LV_USE_CANVAS` now board-overridable via `#ifndef` guard in lv_conf.h
- PWM backlight brightness control with board-configurable frequency and duty range
  - New defines: `TFT_BACKLIGHT_PWM_FREQ`, `TFT_BACKLIGHT_DUTY_MIN`, `TFT_BACKLIGHT_DUTY_MAX`
  - LEDC PWM attached before LCD panel init to prevent GPIO reconfiguration glitch
  - ESP32-4848S040 tuned to 3.5 kHz (no coil whine, smooth dimming, duty 77–252)

### Fixed
- Critical single-core bug: `rtos_create_task_psram_stack` passed string literal instead of task function pointer
- Unified LVGL flush callback to single code path (was three separate paths with dead direct-mode logic)

### Removed
- Dead display_driver.h methods: `getFramebuffer()`, `getLVGLDirectBuffers()`, `swapBuffers()`
- Per-board watchdog (unnecessary — Arduino default WDT already watches IDLE tasks)

### Documentation
- Added `docs/esp32-4848s040.md` board guide (display, touch, memory, LVGL integration)
- Updated `docs/compile-time-flags.md` with new ST7701 defines
